ML recommendation and prediction model for Top European football leagues

# Motivation
I have been a football fan for almost 15 years now. The one thing that I have experienced from watching and analysing so many matches over the years, is that no matter what players a team has, or the form they have been playing with, on a given day, the result is truly unpredictable. Yes, the team with better team chemistry and talent will always have the higher odds but what transpires in the 90 minutes is all that matters. Factors like how cohesive is the team, how many touches did the top players have, the formation, line up, the intention, winning duels, shots on goal, injuries, luck and many more, are simply volatile and too erratic to predict on any given day.

I have been a Barcelona supporter since 2005 and lately the team has been throwing games left and right with few good spells in between. 
I could see that certain formations, player positions, combinations were really affecting the way the team played. There are ML models online that calculate the odds, expected goals, probability of winning based on few factors, but is there a better way of putting some order into this chaos that we love. 

Do the individual performances and stats only mean something if they are in the right setting? e,g, the lineup, formation, minutes played, games played, teammates, mistakes, duels won and lost, attempts at goal, or just luck. 

The players play a huge role in winning games but a better team doesn't necessarily win against a weak team on a given day. That would make the game really boring. So if any team can win on a given day, why do past stats and performances even matter ? Why do teams want best players to play for them ? What makes a team better than other teams ? How does a weak team win against a better team ? is it always luck or is there something more ?

This motivated me to take a stab at trying to predict the outcome of a game based off of real time stats of players. The model will learn the outcome of games where
