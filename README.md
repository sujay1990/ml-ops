# Motivation
I have been a football fan for almost 15 years now. The one thing that I have experienced from watching and analysing so many matches over the years, is that no matter what players a team has, or the form they have been playing with, on a given day, the result is truly unpredictable. Yes, the team with better team chemistry and talent always have higher odds but what transpires in the 90 minutes is all that matters. Factors like how cohesive is the team, how many touches did the top players have, the formation, line up, the intention, winning duels, shots on goal and many more, are simply volatile and too erratic to predict on any given day
